YTU-CE Semantic Web Graduate Course- HW Assignment 1- XSD, XML 

What is this project about? 
In this project, I have tried to show the structure of CBRT in XML format according to a certain XSD. 
What are the files about? 
Instructions of the professor (Dr. Mehmet Akta≈ü) could be found in instuctions.pdf 
Tcmb.xsd contains xml schemas, I want to put some xml files which use this schema too. 
The JAVA project verifies and parses the xml files both with DOM and SAX parser and queries xml with XPATH. 
There is also XSLT a program to convert xmls to html. 
I put a project report that includes my experiences and a brief comparison of Dom and Sax parsers effectiveness. 
Enjoy!
